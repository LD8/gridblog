Is it because the last step is to add the PRIVATE Key explicitly?\n\n### Step 3: Add the new SSH key to your Github account\nThis is quit straight forward. Follow the steps [here on GitHub official Help](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.17/user/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).\n\nWindows and Linux user please refer to the [instruction](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.17/user/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) on github.."}},"context":{}}
