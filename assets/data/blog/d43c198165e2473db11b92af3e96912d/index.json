To use it as a blog, simply create a markdown (.md) file for each post and you're set.\n\nIf you're like me who also use Gist to share non non-blogging content, simply append `#blog` to blog Gist titles. Doing so allows us to search blog posts: [`user:ww9 #blog`](https://gist.github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Aww9+%23blog)\n\n## Search\n\nFilters that work in Gist search.\n\n**Search**|**Gists**\n:-----|:-----\nstars:>100|with more than 100 stars\nuser:ww9|from user `ww9`\n#blog|with `#blog` in title or content\nNOT #misc|not containing `#misc` in title or content\nextension:go|with `.go` files\nforks:<200|with less than 200 forks\nsize:1000..4000|having a file between 1000kb and 4000kb\nsize:>4000|having a file larger than 4000kb\n\n## Search examples\n\n**Search**|**Result**\n:-----|:-----\n[#blog user:ww9](https://gist.github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%23blog+user%3Aww9)|My blog posts\n[stars:>100 extension:go](https://gist.github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=stars%3A%3E100+extension%3Ago&ref=searchresults)|.go gists with more than 100 stars\n\n## Comments\n\nUsers can upload images in comments simply copying and pasting the image using CTRL+V. Drag-n-Drop works as well. I guess this wont work on mobile phones.\n\nYou can delete any comment from your gists.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Multiple files in a post are listed in alphabetical order. To make a file appear first on the list, prepend its name with a space. To make it appear last, prepend filename with `~`. Numbers also work.\n\n## Tools\n\n**Tool**|**Notes**\n:-----|:-----\n[GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/)|Comprehensive\n[Stackedit - online markdown editor](https://stackedit.io)|Feature rich with live preview.
